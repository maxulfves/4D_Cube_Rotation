# 4D_Cube_Rotation
A demo showing a representation of a tesseract rotating around the xy and wz planes. 

## How to compile
Developed using QT Creator. A comprehensive building guide will be added at some point. 

## Bugs/left to do: 
- Uses too many hardcoded values. Should be checked out and clarified if the demo is developed further. 
- Improve documentation. 
- Debug, check for memory leaks etc. 
- Add option for chosing rotation matrix.
